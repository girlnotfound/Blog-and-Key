# Blog and Key

## This project involved developing a personal blog site aimed at sharing my thoughts and experiences.

- Blog and Key lets users easily create and view posts, focusing on keeping things simple and interactive. Working on this blog site really boosted my skills in managing web forms, handling local storage, and adding user-friendly features. One big challenge was making sure the data stayed organized and easy to access, especially when pulling it from and displaying it in localStorage.

## User Interface

- Upon loading the application, users are greeted with a landing page that includes a form for entering their username, blog title, and blog content.

- After filling out the form, users can submit their entries. The blog post data is then stored in the browser's localStorage, ensuring data persistence even after the browser is closed.

- When the form is submitted, users are redirected to the posts page where they can view all the blog posts.

- Users can switch between light and dark modes, according to their preference.

- A "Back" button is available to navigate back to the previous page.

- The list of blog posts is dynamically pulled from localStorage.

- Users can see each post's title, content, and the author's username.

- Viewing localStorage directly shows a JSON array of blog post objects, with details such as the post author's username, title, and content.

## Technologies Used

- HTML/CSS for structuring and styling.

- JavaScript for the interactive elements and managing localStorage.
